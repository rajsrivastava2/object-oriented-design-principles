# Interface Segregation Principle
Interface Segregation Principle states that no clients should be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

This often becomes a problem when clients have dependencies on "fat" classes ( which refers to classes have too many responsibilities). Having an interface to seperate behaviors is good idea. It prevents tight coupling between objects.

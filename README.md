# object-oriented-design-principles

## Overview
This repository contains the sample Java implementations for the object-oriented design principles of SOLID (single responsibility, open-closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation and dependency inversion). Good OOP design enables the software's source code to become both legible and extensible for Agile software development. 

## Content
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
⋅⋅* a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only one potential change in the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)

2. Open/closed Principle (OCP)
⋅⋅* “software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
..* “objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.”

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
⋅⋅* “many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
⋅⋅* one should “Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.”
